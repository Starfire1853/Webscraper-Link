###What I Did:
I was in charge of the input section, so I imported all the necessary libraries. I went and tried to do Sam's portion on my own in multiple ways, one of which is under my Input branch called "Magic Happens Scratch". I created the flowchart and did part of and initiated the Specifics branch. I also took time to understand the code of my peers, obviously.
